<h2>Stock Program</h2>
<h4>Created by: Danny Valentine and Baer Istok</h4>
<p>
  This program converts our old text based application into a new GUI based application using
  JSwing. The program is capable of creating new portfolios, adding stocks to a given portfolio,
  finding the value of a portfolio on a given day, finding the composition of a portfolio on a given
  day, and both saving and loading portfolios.
</p>
<p>
  In order for any of the portions of our application to run, it must have a valid portfolio to
  apply it to, as well as every section of the given field filled out. If either of these are not
  fulfilled, no method will not be called on the portfolio.
