<h2>Stock Program</h2>
<h4>Created by: Danny Valentine and Baer Istok</h4>
<p>
  This program utilises a text-based interface to allow a user to examine the gain or loss of a 
  stock over a specified period, examine the x-day moving average of a stock for a specified date 
  and a specified value of x, determine which days are x-day crossovers for a specified stock over 
  a specified date range and a specified value of x, and create one or more portfolios, add or 
  remove stock to a portfolio, view the contents of a portfolio, and find the value of that 
  portfolio on a specific date.
</p>
<p>
  The structure of the code is based on the model, view, controller format, with both the main 
  functionality and the portfolio functionality each having their own controllers, models, and 
  views.
