Stock Program Setup

Created by: Daniel Valentine and Baer Istok

This program can simply be run by running the JAR file given. It is worth noting that any portfolio
.txt files you wish to load MUST be located in the given "saved_portfolios" folder. Aside from that,
the application is incredibly self explanatory. The only reasons that any of the methods shouldn't
be returning anything are either that not all of the fields have valid inputs, or that the portfolio
you are trying to call it on do not exist. Simply use the correct inputs and create a portfolio to
fix both of this problems.
