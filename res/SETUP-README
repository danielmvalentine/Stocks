Stock Program Setup

Created by: Daniel Valentine and Baer Istok

The program can be run by simply running class StockProgram.
The program can run with any stock that is hosted on the Alpha Vantage API.
Two example stocks that work are GOOL and APPL, but it should work with other ones listed as well.
Dates tested include 2015-05-05, 2015-05-26, and 2016-05-05.

1.
To create a porfolio, begin the program by running StockProgram, and navigate down to the portfolio option by entering 4.
You can then create a new portfolio by entering 1, and you may name it whatever you like.
You can then add stocks to this portfolio by entering 3 and adding the four digit ticker of whatever stock you would like.
Examples of stocks that would work include GOOL, APPL, and AMZN.

2.
To create a second portfolio, continue without closing the program from the first step.
Enter 1 and name your second portfolio whatever you would like.
You can then enter 6 and enter the name of your portfolio to return the value of that total portfolio.
